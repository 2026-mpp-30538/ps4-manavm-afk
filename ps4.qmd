"This submission is my work alone and complies with the 30538 integrity policy." Add your initials to indicate your agreement: **MM**

### Github Classroom Assignment Setup and Submission Instructions

1.  **Accepting and Setting up the PS4 Assignment Repository**
    -   Each student must individually accept the repository for the problem set from Github Classroom ("ps4") -- <https://classroom.github.com/a/hWhtcHqH>
        -   You will be prompted to select your cnetid from the list in order to link your Github account to your cnetid.
        -   If you can't find your cnetid in the link above, click "continue to next step" and accept the assignment, then add your name, cnetid, and Github account to this Google Sheet and we will manually link it: <https://rb.gy/9u7fb6>
    -   If you authenticated and linked your Github account to your device, you should be able to clone your PS4 assignment repository locally.
    -   Contents of PS4 assignment repository:
        -   `ps4_template.qmd`: this is the Quarto file with the template for the problem set. You will write your answers to the problem set here.
2.  **Submission Process**:
    -   Knit your completed solution `ps4.qmd` as a pdf `ps4.pdf`.
        -   Your submission does not need runnable code. Instead, you will tell us either what code you ran or what output you got.
    -   To submit, push `ps4.qmd` and `ps4.pdf` to your PS4 assignment repository. Confirm on Github.com that your work was successfully pushed.

### Grading
- You will be graded on what was last pushed to your PS4 assignment repository before the assignment deadline
- Problem sets will be graded for completion as: {missing (0%); ✓- (incomplete, 50%); ✓+ (excellent, 100%)}
    - The percent values assigned to each problem denote how long we estimate the problem will take as a share of total time spent on the problem set, not the points they are associated with.
- In order for your submission to be considered complete, you need to push both your `ps4.qmd` and `ps4.pdf` to your repository. Submissions that do not include both files will automatically receive 50% credit.

## Step 1: Develop initial scraper and crawler


```{python}
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

# 1. GET the webpage
url = "https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/"
headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36"
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'lxml')

# 2. Find all entries
entries = soup.find_all('div', class_='usa-card__container')
actions = []

for entry in entries:
    row = {}
    
    # --- TITLE & LINK ---
    try:
        heading = entry.find('h2', class_='usa-card__heading')
        title_tag = heading.find('a')
        row['Title'] = title_tag.text.strip()
        row['Link'] = "https://oig.hhs.gov" + title_tag['href']
    except:
        row['Title'] = "N/A"
        row['Link'] = "N/A"
    
    # --- DATE ---
    try:
        # Based on your HTML, the date is in this specific span
        date_tag = entry.find('span', class_='text-base-dark')
        row['Date'] = date_tag.text.strip()
    except:
        row['Date'] = "N/A"

    # --- CATEGORY (THE FIX) ---
    try:
        # We look for the <ul> with the class "display-inline add-list-reset"
        # as seen in your printed HTML
        category_list = entry.find('ul', class_='display-inline add-list-reset')
        
        if category_list:
            categories = [li.text.strip() for li in category_list.find_all('li')]
            row['Category'] = ", ".join(categories)
        else:
            row['Category'] = "N/A"
    except:
        row['Category'] = "N/A"
    
    actions.append(row)

# 3. Create DataFrame and Check
df_step1 = pd.DataFrame(actions)
print(df_step1.head())
```


## Step 2: Making the scraper dynamic

### 1. Turning the scraper into a function 

* a. Pseudo-Code


* b. Create Dynamic Scraper

```{python}

```

* c. Test Your Code

```{python}

```

## Step 3: Plot data based on scraped data

### 1. Plot the number of enforcement actions over time

```{python}

```

### 2. Plot the number of enforcement actions categorized:

* based on "Criminal and Civil Actions" vs. "State Enforcement Agencies"

```{python}

```

* based on five topics

```{python}

```
